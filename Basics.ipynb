    "## Running Julia Code\n",
    "The Julia REPL is much like the one which you find in Matlab. You are able to run a single command at a time and look at a common workspace. This is a great way to tackle simple debugging or to do a simple computation. However, the most common way to interact through your experiments will be by running a Julia script file of some sort, denoted like by the `*.jl` extension. Given a Julia script, lets say, `foo.jl`, we can run this command from the terminal via\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bash> julia foo.jl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we can run it from the REPL via\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "julia> include(\"foo.jl\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, here, the use of the function `include(...)`. This function will execute the contents of a script file within the current context of the REPL. Though, we must be careful if we are re-defining certain procedures. Depending on what our script does, sometimes running it twice in succession might result in undefined results due to redefinitions or overwritten variables.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "julia> include(\"foo.jl\")\n",

    "julia> include(\"foo.jl\")\n",
    "(...perhaps and error or unepxected output...)\n",

    "Another first thing to cover is how to find the information you need about specific functions. Most of the packages in Julia are well-documented. Of course, in fast-moving, new packages, there is often a lot of work to be done. However, all the core functionality has some good documentation. Lets say we want to know something about the fast Fourier transform (FFT). First, lets take a look at the documentaiton for the `apropos(...)` function. Note that if we want to know about a function, we just need to use the `?` prefix in the REPL."
