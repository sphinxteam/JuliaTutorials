HDF5 offers us an \"easy\" way to save and access experimental data in a portable way, as HDF5 is an open standard and has been implemented in Java, Matlab, Mathematica, Python, R, and of course for our purposes, Julia. This is in contrast to, for example, the Matlab-specific `.mat` file format. While other open approaches, such as pickling (Python), XML, or even raw CSV dumps, can be used, these methods don't scale well to the storage of large sets of diverse data. \n"
